## What is a Data Structure?

A data structure is a way of organizing, storing, and managing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently.

## Types of Data Structures

### 1. Linear Data Structures
- **Arrays**: Fixed-size sequential collection
- **Linked Lists**: Dynamic collection with nodes
- **Stacks**: LIFO (Last In, First Out)
- **Queues**: FIFO (First In, First Out)

### 2. Non-Linear Data Structures
- **Trees**: Hierarchical structure
- **Graphs**: Network of nodes and edges
- **Hash Tables**: Key-value pairs

## Time Complexity

| Operation | Array | Linked List | Stack | Queue |
|-----------|-------|-------------|-------|-------|
| Access    | O(1)  | O(n)        | O(n)  | O(n)  |
| Search    | O(n)  | O(n)        | O(n)  | O(n)  |
| Insert    | O(n)  | O(1)        | O(1)  | O(1)  |
| Delete    | O(n)  | O(1)        | O(1)  | O(1)  |

## Abstract Data Types (ADT)

An ADT is a theoretical concept that defines:
1. Data stored
2. Operations on the data
3. Error conditions
